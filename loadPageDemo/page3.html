<h3>ESRI World Image - Page 3.</h3>
Content for page 3 shows ESRI World Imagery.<br><br>
No head or HTML tags are included on this page.<br>
Instead the code is just loaded as a part of the parent HTML of the index file.<br>
This creates an interesting issue because this page will not reder if loaded directly in the browser as it relies on the structure of index.html.<br><br>
