 After blizzards and freezing rain poured through central Iowa, fire hydrants have been lost in the snow that has been piling up around town. Not only do community members wish for even a day of over 30 degrees to help melt away some of the snow and ice, but so does law enforcement — specifically firefighters. Ames Fire Department Training Officer Josh Bennett said the department struggles with the mounds of snow hiding the fire hydrants. “We have had a lot of hydrants with the snow stacked on top of snow,” he said. “It’s just been tough to get them all dug down and ready to go (for emergencies).” Bennett said after last weekend’s blizzard, residents shared their concern with the fire department regarding where the fire hydrants were in their neighborhood so they could do their part to help the department. <br><br>
    The Ames Fire Department decided to share the hydrant snow removal status map which was originally an internal tool the fire department used for their own needs. “As (firefighters) are contacted (for calls), they can update that (map) as they are driving,” Bennett said. Now, residents can see where those fire hydrants are and clear them, so as firefighters travel around Ames, they can update the map. The decision to release the map was a way for residents to know how they can help firefighters due to underlying problems that come with uncleared fire hydrants and fighting fires.
    <br><br>“A motivated fire fighter can clear the snow (around a fire hydrant) in two to three minutes,” Bennett said. The difference two to three minutes can make is due to the available water on a fire truck. Bennett said a hose line on a truck carries 500 gallons of water that flows about 160 gallons per minute. That equals 3 1/2 minutes of water before a fire hydrant is needed. “That leaves us with one minute left without having the fire hydrant,” he said. Those minutes can also make the difference between the loss of a home or business in a fire, Bennett said. “If it were a fire (that has a cleared hydrant), we could have contained to the room of origin,” he said. Comparatively, if firefighters have to take the extra time to dig out a fire hydrant that’s buried in snow, it could mean the loss of the entire structure, Bennett said. “Once it gains momentum, you can lose that (structure),” he said. “You really have one shot.”Another issue that Bennett said comes with needing to clear a fire hydrant is the firefighter digging in the snow having to come back to help the crew. “Firefighters that make the hydrant connection have to come back in the crew to fight the fire,” he said. “That’s one more person that can’t drag out a victim or fight a fire because of that.”
